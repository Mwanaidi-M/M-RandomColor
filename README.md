# M-RandomColor
## Random Color Generator

This was a project inspired by the site [webfx.com](https://www.webfx.com/web-design/random-color-picker/) and 
wanted to do something on my own from that. 

This is a site that generates a random hex color and its rgb value when the spacebar is clicked. It was a fun project to
do and enjoyable.
